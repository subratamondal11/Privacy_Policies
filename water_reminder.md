## Water Reminder: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Water Reminder app for Android!

As an Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any information.

Extended Declaration of Non-Data Collection and Personal Use

- I. Introduction & Purpose of the App

```console
I, Subrata Mondal, the sole developer of the mobile application "Water Reminder", hereby issue this voluntary declaration to be fully transparent about the nature and function of my application.

This app was created purely as a personal hobby and passion project. It is a direct result of my interest in solving a specific problem. The development process itself is the primary reward.
```

- II. Declaration on Data Collection

```console
To the very best of my knowledge and belief, and in accordance with my technical implementation, I formally declare that:

No Data Collection: I have not programmed this application to collect, transmit, or store any personal or non-personal information from its users or their devices.

No Third-Party Services: The app does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or data-tracking frameworks (such as Google Analytics, Facebook SDK, etc.).

No External Transmission: The app does not communicate with any external servers or databases owned by me or any third party. All processing occurs locally on the user's device.

Permissions Justification: If the app requests any device permissions (such as Exact Alarm Permission), they are used solely for the app's core, offline functionality and are not exploited for data harvesting.
```

- III. Statement of Non-Commercial Intent

```console
I explicitly and unequivocally state that this application is not intended for commercial use or revenue generation. It is offered free of charge and without any advertisements. My motivation is strictly non-commercial, driven by a desire to share the utility or enjoyment I've found in this project with others who might also appreciate it.
```

- IV. Conclusion

```console
In summary, this app is a hobbyist project built for fun and utility, not for profit or data. My commitment is to provide a simple, respectful, and private user experience.
```

Sincerely,
